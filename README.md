# Assembly-Simple-VM
A simplified version of  an Assembly language interpreter

This was for a project done in an Assembly programming course I took at my university.
Be sure to read the documentation included for guides on what the VM is capable of. REMEMBER! This isn't a one-to-one recreation of an entire language, so there are some limitations!
